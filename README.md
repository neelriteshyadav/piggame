Enter player names and click the 'New Game' button to start a new game.
The current player can roll the die by clicking the 'Roll Dice' button.
If the player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and their round score becomes 0. The next player then takes their turn.
If the player rolls a number other than 1, that number is added to their round score.
The player can continue to roll the die as many times as they want, but they can choose to 'Hold' at any time, which means their round score is added to their total score and the next player takes their turn.
The first player to reach the winning score (default 100) wins the game.
